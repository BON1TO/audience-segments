# 🎯 Audience Segments Platform

A **full-stack marketing segmentation platform** that helps businesses group their users into smart, actionable segments.  
Marketers can either **define rules manually** (e.g., `visits > 50`, `total_spend > 10000`) or use **AI-assisted natural language prompts** like:

> example- “Show me people who haven’t visited in 5 months but spent more than ₹5000”

The system translates this into structured rules and MongoDB queries, calculates audience sizes, and links them to campaigns.
